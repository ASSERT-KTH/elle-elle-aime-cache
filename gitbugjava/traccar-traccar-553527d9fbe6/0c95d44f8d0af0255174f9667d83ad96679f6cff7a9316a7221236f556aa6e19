Looking at the code, we see that there are multiple places where the `Position.KEY_BATTERY` is set. The most likely candidates for setting this value are in the main decoding logic or in the switch statement handling different subtypes.\n\n3. The fix likely involves ensuring that the correct value is set for the `Position.KEY_BATTERY` when the subtype 0xFE is encountered, as this seems to be the relevant part of the code for setting the battery level.\n\nHere's the fixed version of the `decodeLocation` function:\n",
