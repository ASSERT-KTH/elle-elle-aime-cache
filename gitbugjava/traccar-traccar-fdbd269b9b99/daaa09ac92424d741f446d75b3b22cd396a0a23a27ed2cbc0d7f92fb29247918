Specifically, the issues arise when handling HDOP (key 0x12) and device temperature (key 0x82).\n\n### Approach\n1. **HDOP (Key 0x12):** Change the parsing from `Integer.parseInt` to `Double.parseDouble`.\n2. **Device Temperature (Key 0x82):** Change the parsing from `Integer.parseInt` to `Double.parseDouble` and then apply the multiplier.\n\n### Solution Code",
