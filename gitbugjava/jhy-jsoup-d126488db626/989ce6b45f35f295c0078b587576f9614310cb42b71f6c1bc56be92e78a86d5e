If it does, it breaks out of the loop; otherwise, it consumes the combinator.\n\n5. **Default case:**\n   ```java\n   else {\n       sq.append(tq.consume());\n   }\n   ```\n   For any other token, it appends the consumed token to `sq`.\n\n6. **Return the result:**\n   ```java\n   return StringUtil.releaseBuilder(sq);\n   ```\n   Releases the `StringBuilder` back to the utility class and returns the built string.\n\nNow, considering the test failure, it seems like the sub-query is not being consumed correctly, leading to extra elements being selected. Probably, the way combinators are handled is causing the selector to be broader than intended.\n\nLooking specifically at the combinators part:\n",
