Additionally, ensuring that all test cases are passing will validate that the fixes are effective across different scenarios.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo resolve the `NullPointerException` in the `decode` method of the `Minifinder2ProtocolDecoder` class, we need to ensure that all objects are properly initialized before use and handle cases where data might be missing or incomplete. Specifically, the issue arises when `deviceSession` is null, leading to a NullPointerException when trying to access `deviceSession.getDeviceId()`.\n\n### Solution Code\n",
