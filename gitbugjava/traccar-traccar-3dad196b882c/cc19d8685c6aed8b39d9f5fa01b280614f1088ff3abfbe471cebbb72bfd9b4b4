This should resolve the `IllegalArgumentException` seen in the tests.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo fix the issue in the `decodePosition` method, we need to ensure that the code does not attempt to read more bytes than are available in the buffer, which was causing a negative value for `minimumReadableBytes`. The problem likely arises from incorrect handling of the lengths of optional subtypes in the buffer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Validate Length Calculation:** Ensure that the length of each subtype is correctly calculated and does not result in negative values.\n2. **Check Buffer Readability:** Before reading any subtype data, confirm that there are sufficient bytes available in the buffer.\n3. **Handle Negative Lengths:** If the length calculation yields a negative value, skip the corresponding bytes to avoid errors.\n4. **Improve Error Handling:** Add checks and logs to handle cases where the buffer does not contain enough data for a subtype.\n\n### Solution Code",
