The issue is that we're subtracting 4 from the length, which can lead to negative values if the total length is 4 or less. This causes problems when we try to read the subsequent data.\n\n3. To fix this, we should ensure we don't subtract 4 from the length and adjust our reading logic accordingly.\n\nHere's the fixed version of the function:\n",
