The original code incorrectly negates the `isEffectivelyFirst()` method, leading to incorrect behavior in certain test cases. By removing this negation, the function correctly determines whether an element should be considered inlineable based on its position and parent properties.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Condition Check**: Ensure the tag is inline. If not, immediately return `false`.\n2. **Parent Check**: Check if the parent is either `null` or a block-level element.\n3. **First Child Check**: Ensure the element is effectively the first child.\n4. **Output Settings Check**: Ensure that outlining is not enabled in the output settings.\n\nThe key fix is to correctly handle the condition for being effectively first without negating it.\n\n### Solution Code",
