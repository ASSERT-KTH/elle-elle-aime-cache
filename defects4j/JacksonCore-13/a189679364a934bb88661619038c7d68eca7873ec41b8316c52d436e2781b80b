The problem lies not within a missing function, but within the `_testFieldNameQuotingEnabled` helper function used in the test, or the way the `JsonFactory`/`JsonGenerator` handles the `QUOTE_FIELD_NAMES` feature.  Since the error message shows both expected and actual values as \"{[foo]:1}\", it indicates that quoting is happening when it shouldn't.  The likely culprit is that the `JsonGenerator.Feature.QUOTE_FIELD_NAMES` setting is not being applied correctly within the `_testFieldNameQuotingEnabled` function.\n\nSince we only have the test code and the error, we need to reconstruct a plausible `_testFieldNameQuotingEnabled` function and fix it:\n",
