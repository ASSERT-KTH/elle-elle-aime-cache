    "generation": "   if (_inputPtr < _inputEnd) {\n       _reportError(\"Still have %d undecoded bytes, should not call 'feedInput'\", _inputEnd - _inputPtr);\n   }\n   ```\n   This checks if there are any undecoded bytes before feeding new input. If there are, it reports an error.\n\n2. **Validate input parameters:**\n   ```java\n   if (end < start) {\n       _reportError(\"Input end (%d) may not be before start (%d)\", end, start);\n   }\n   ```\n   Ensures that the end index is not before the start index.\n\n3. **Check if end-of-input has been marked:**\n   ```java\n   if (_endOfInput) {\n       _reportError(\"Already closed, can not feed more input\");\n   }\n   ```\n   Prevents feeding more input if the end-of-input has been reached.\n\n4. **Update pointers:**\n   ```java\n   _currInputProcessed += _origBufferLen;\n   ```\n   This line accumulates the total bytes processed so far.\n\n5. **Adjust row start:**\n   ```java\n   _currInputRowStart = start - (_inputEnd - _currInputRowStart);\n   ```\n   This seems to adjust the current row start based on the new input. It might be where the offset calculation goes wrong.\n\n6. **Update buffer settings:**\n   ```java\n   _inputBuffer = buf;\n   _inputPtr = start;\n   _inputEnd = end;\n   _origBufferLen = end - start;\n   ```\n   Sets the new input buffer and updates pointers.\n\nGiven the test failure, it appears that the byte offset tracking is incorrect, specifically in how `_currInputProcessed` is being updated.\n\n### Proposed Fix\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to ensure that `_currInputProcessed` accurately reflects the total bytes processed up to the current point. One possible problem is that `_origBufferLen` might not correctly represent the length of the original buffer.\n\nLet's adjust the update of `_currInputProcessed` to directly account for the bytes processed before feeding new input.\n\nHere\u2019s the revised `feedInput` function:\n",
