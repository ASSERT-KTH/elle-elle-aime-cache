    "generation": "   if (!isValidDeclaration(declaration)\n       || !isValidInitialization(initialization)\n       || !isValidReference(reference)) {\n     return false;\n   }\n   ```\n\n   These checks ensure that the declaration, initialization, and reference are valid for inlining. If any of them are not valid, it skips inlining.\n\n2. **Single use check:**\n\n   ```java\n   if (declaration != initialization &&\n       !initialization.getGrandparent().isExprResult()) {\n     return false;\n   }\n   ```\n\n   This seems to check if the declaration and initialization are different nodes and if the initialization is not an expression result. If so, it returns false, possibly because the value is used multiple times.\n\n3. **Control structure and scope boundaries:**\n\n   ```java\n   if (declaration.getBasicBlock() != initialization.getBasicBlock()\n       || declaration.getBasicBlock() != reference.getBasicBlock()) {\n     return false;\n   }\n   ```\n\n   This ensures that all relevant nodes are in the same basic block, meaning they're in the same control flow context.\n\n4. **Avoid inlining into call nodes:**\n\n   ```java\n   Node value = initialization.getAssignedValue();\n   Preconditions.checkState(value != null);\n   if (value.isGetProp()\n       && reference.getParent().isCall()\n       && reference.getParent().getFirstChild() == reference.getNode()) {\n     return false;\n   }\n   ```\n\n   This check prevents inlining when the assigned value is a property get and the reference is used as the first argument in a call node. This is to prevent changing the context in which the call is made.\n\n5. **Handling function values:**\n\n   ```java\n   if (value.isFunction()) {\n     Node callNode = reference.getParent();\n     if (reference.getParent().isCall()) {\n       CodingConvention convention = compiler.getCodingConvention();\n       // Bug 2388531: Don't inline subclass definitions into class defining\n       // calls as this confused class removing logic.\n       SubclassRelationship relationship =\n           convention.getClassesDefinedByCall(callNode);\n       if (relationship != null) {\n         return false;\n       }\n\n       // issue 668: Don't inline singleton getter methods\n       // calls as this confused class removing logic.\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Here, if the assigned value is a function, and it's being called, it checks if inlining would confuse the class removing logic, particularly in cases involving subclass definitions or singleton getters.\n\n6. **Final checks:**\n\n   ```java\n   return canMoveAggressively(value) ||\n       canMoveModerately(initialization, reference);\n   ```\n\n   If none of the previous conditions prevent inlining, it checks if the value can be moved aggressively or moderately based on other criteria.\n\nNow, looking at the failing test, it's about singleton getters, and the error is an `AssertionFailedError`. This likely means that the test expects certain output or behavior, but the actual result doesn't match.\n\nGiven that the test is related to singleton getters and the code has a comment specifically about not inlining singleton getter methods, it's probable that the issue is in how the `canInline` function handles references related to these singleton getters.\n\nLooking back at the code, there's a section commented as:\n",
