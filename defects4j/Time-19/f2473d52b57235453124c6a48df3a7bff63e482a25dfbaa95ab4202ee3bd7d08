    "generation": "   final int offsetLocal = getOffset(instantLocal);\n   ```\n   This gets the initial offset assuming `instantLocal` is already in the local time.\n\n2. **Adjusting the Instant:**\n   ```java\n   final long instantAdjusted = instantLocal - offsetLocal;\n   final int offsetAdjusted = getOffset(instantAdjusted);\n   ```\n   Here, it adjusts the instant by subtracting the initial offset to estimate the UTC time and then gets the offset for this adjusted time.\n\n3. **Checking for Offset Difference:**\n   ```java\n   if (offsetLocal != offsetAdjusted) {\n       // handle DST boundary\n   } else if (offsetLocal > 0) {\n       // handle potential previous transition\n   }\n   ```\n   If the offsets differ, it indicates a DST transition, and the code attempts to handle it by checking if the offset difference is negative and adjusting accordingly.\n\n### Identifying the Bug\n\nThe bug seems to be in how the function handles the transition from BST to GMT. In London, when DST ends, the clock is set back one hour, causing an hour to be repeated. This is a DST overlap situation.\n\nIn such cases, the function should favor the earlier instant. However, the current implementation appears to be picking the later instant or not handling the overlap correctly, resulting in an incorrect offset being applied.\n\n### Correcting the Function\n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that during a DST overlap, the function chooses the earlier instant. Also, we need to make sure that during a DST gap, it chooses the later instant.\n\nHere's a revised version of the function:\n",
