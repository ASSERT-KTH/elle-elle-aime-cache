Specifically:\n\n1. **Check for \"/*@\"** to catch comments that start with \"/* @\".\n2. **Check for \"\\n * @\"** to catch comments where lines start with \" * @\" after the initial \"/*\".\n\nAdditionally, to handle different types of newline characters (e.g., \"\\r\\n\" on Windows), we should make the newline detection more flexible.\n\nHere's an improved version of the `handleBlockComment` function:\n",
