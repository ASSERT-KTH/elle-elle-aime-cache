However, the function isn't detecting this correctly.\n\nLooking back at the code, the check for positive-definiteness seems to only check if the diagonal elements are greater than a threshold. But this is not sufficient to ensure positive-definiteness. A matrix can have all diagonal elements positive but still not be positive definite if some leading principal minors are not positive.\n\nTherefore, the issue lies in the positive-definiteness check. It's too lenient and doesn't fully verify if the matrix is positive definite.\n\nTo fix this, I need to implement a proper check for positive-definiteness, which involves checking that all leading principal minors are positive.\n\nHowever, computing all leading principal minors can be computationally expensive for large matrices, as it involves computing determinants of submatrices.\n\nAn efficient way to check positive-definiteness in the context of Cholesky decomposition is to perform the decomposition and check if all diagonal elements of the lower triangular matrix L are positive. If any of them are not positive, then the matrix is not positive definite.\n\nIn the Cholesky decomposition algorithm, if the matrix is not positive definite, you'll encounter a situation where you're taking the square root of a non-positive number.\n\nLooking at the code, in the decomposition loop, there's this line:\n",
