Although the method checks if `startIndex >= size` and returns -1, there might be cases where `startIndex` is set to `size` exactly, and if `strLen` is 0, it returns `startIndex`, which is `size`. But according to the method's comment, starting at `size` should mean the search doesn't find anything, as there are no characters left to search.\n\nWait, in the method, if `strLen == 0`, it returns `startIndex` regardless of `startIndex` being equal to `size`. Is this the intended behavior?\n\nLooking at the Java `String` class's `indexOf` method, when the search string is empty, it returns the start index if it's within the bounds, but according to the method's comment, starting at `size` should return -1 because there are no characters left to search.\n\nPerhaps this is where the issue lies. Let's adjust the method to handle the empty string case more carefully.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure that all indices being accessed in the buffer array are within the valid range.\n\nLet me propose a fix:\n\n1. **Adjust the empty string case:**\n   - If `strLen == 0`, return `startIndex` only if `startIndex < size`.\n   - If `startIndex >= size`, return -1.\n\n2. **Ensure that in the main search loop, `i + strLen` does not exceed `size`**:\n   - The current implementation sets `len = thisBuf.length - strLen`, which should prevent accessing indices beyond the buffer's length.\n   - However, I need to make sure that `thisBuf.length` is equal to `size`, as `size` is the current length of the string builder.\n\nAssuming that `buffer` is the underlying array and `size` is the current length of the string, I need to ensure that `thisBuf.length` is at least `size`, but it's possible that `thisBuf.length > size`, especially if the buffer has been reallocated.\n\nTo make sure, I should use `size` instead of `thisBuf.length` when calculating `len`.\n\nLet me adjust the code accordingly:\n",
