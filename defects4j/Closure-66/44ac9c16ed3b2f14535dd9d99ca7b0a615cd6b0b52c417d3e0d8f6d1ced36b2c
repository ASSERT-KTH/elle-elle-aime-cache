    "generation": "\n   /** @enum {number} */ keys = {A: 1,B: 2,C: 3};\n\n   ```\n\n   The expected typed percentage is 100%, but it's coming out as approximately 66.67%. This suggests that only two out of three keys are being correctly typed.\n\n2. In `testGetTypedPercent6`, an object is defined:\n\n   ```javascript\n\n   a = {TRUE: 1, FALSE: 0};\n\n   ```\n\n   Again, the expected typed percentage is 100%, but it's coming out as approximately 66.67%. This indicates a similar issue where not all parts of the object literal are being accounted for in the typing.\n\nGiven that the typed percentage is calculated based on the number of typeable nodes that are typed, it appears that some nodes within object literals are not being properly marked as typed, hence the lower percentage.\n\nUpon closer inspection of the `case Token.OBJECTLIT:` block:\n\n- It checks if the node has a JSType; if not, it falls back to ensuring the node is typed.\n\n- If the parent has an enum type, it assigns that type to the object literal.\n\n- It then visits each key in the object literal using `visitObjLitKey`.\n\nHowever, it's possible that the keys themselves are not being marked as typed correctly, or perhaps the values are not being considered in the typing percentage.\n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that both the keys and the values in the object literal are being properly accounted for in the typed percentage calculation.\n\nHere's a revised version of the `case Token.OBJECTLIT:` block:\n",
