    "generation": "   char prev = getLastChar();\n   boolean negativeZero = isNegativeZero(x);\n   if (x < 0 && prev == '-') {\n     add(\" \");\n   }\n   ```\n   This part checks if the previous character is a minus sign and adds a space if `x` is negative. However, it seems that this logic is not sufficient for handling negative zero properly.\n\n2. **Handle integer values:**\n   ```java\n   if ((long) x == x && !negativeZero) {\n     long value = (long) x;\n     long mantissa = value;\n     int exp = 0;\n     if (Math.abs(x) >= 100) {\n       while (mantissa / 10 * Math.pow(10, exp + 1) == value) {\n         mantissa /= 10;\n         exp++;\n       }\n     }\n     if (exp > 2) {\n       add(Long.toString(mantissa) + \"E\" + Integer.toString(exp));\n     } else {\n       add(Long.toString(value));\n     }\n   } else {\n     add(String.valueOf(x));\n   }\n   ```\n   This part handles the formatting of integer values, potentially using scientific notation for large numbers, and falls back to `String.valueOf(x)` for other cases.\n\n**Problem Identification:**\n\nThe test failure suggests that there is no space added between two minus signs in certain cases, leading to misparsing (e.g., `x--0.0` instead of `x- -0.0`).\n\n**Solution Approach:**\n\nWe need to ensure that when `x` is negative, and the previous character is a minus sign, a space is added to separate them. Additionally, we need to handle negative zero correctly, ensuring it is represented as `-0.0`.\n\n**Fixed Function:**\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to adjust the spacing logic to handle negative zero and ensure proper separation of minus signs.\n",
