Ensure that this flag is updated correctly.\n\n3. **Convergence Criteria:**\n   - The check `if (FastMath.abs(f1) <= ftol)` might be too lenient or not aligning with the desired precision.\n   - The interval size check `if (FastMath.abs(x1 - x0) < FastMath.max(rtol * FastMath.abs(x1), atol))` seems correct, but ensure that `rtol` and `atol` are set appropriately.\n\n4. **Initial Bracketing:**\n   - Ensure that `verifyBracketing(x0, x1)` correctly confirms that the initial interval brackets a root.\n\n### Proposed Fixes\n\n1. **Correct Function Value Updates:**\n   - For the ILLINOIS method, the function value should be halved when the new point replaces the older bound.\n   - For the PEGASUS method, the update formula needs to be verified against standard references.\n\n2. **Ensure Interval Update Logic:**\n   - Make sure that when the interval is updated, the function values are correctly assigned to `x0` and `x1`.\n\n3. **Refine Convergence Checks:**\n   - Consider adding more stringent checks or combining multiple criteria to ensure convergence.\n\n4. **Debugging Output:**\n   - Temporarily add print statements to monitor the progression of `x0`, `x1`, `f0`, `f1`, and `fx` to diagnose slow convergence or oscillations.\n\n### Fixed Code\n\nHere\u2019s the revised version of the `doSolve` method with corrections applied:\n",
