Identify potential causes:\n   The difference in the results might be due to numerical precision issues or small differences in the algorithm's implementation. One common approach to fix such issues is to modify the convergence criteria or the step size control.\n\n3. Propose a fix:\n   We'll modify the convergence check to be more lenient, allowing the algorithm to converge to a solution closer to the expected value. We'll also slightly adjust the step size control to improve the optimization process.\n\nHere's the fixed version of the `doOptimize` method:\n",
