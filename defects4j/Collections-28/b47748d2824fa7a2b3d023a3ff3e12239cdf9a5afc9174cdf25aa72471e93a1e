The `prefixMap` view isn't properly reflecting changes back to the main trie. Unfortunately, without access to the original `PatriciaTrie` code, I cannot provide a direct fix.\n\nHowever, based on the error and the test case, the issue likely stems from the `prefixMap`'s `clear()` method not correctly removing the entries from the underlying trie. A possible solution involves iterating through the keys of the `prefixMap` and removing them individually from the trie within the `prefixMap.clear()` implementation.\n\nHere's a hypothetical example of how a fix might look within the `PatriciaTrie` class, assuming some internal methods and structure.  This is a **guess** without seeing the real code.\n",
