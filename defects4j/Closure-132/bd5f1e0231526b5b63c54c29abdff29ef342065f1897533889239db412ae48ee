However, there might be some gaps or missteps in these checks, leading to the transformation being skipped or applied incorrectly in certain cases.\n\nTo fix this, I need to enhance the function to correctly identify and handle these scenarios. Specifically, I need to ensure that:\n\n- The function correctly identifies if both the then and else branches are single-expression blocks.\n\n- It handles assignments with side effects appropriately, ensuring that the side effects occur as intended in the transformed code.\n\n- It correctly constructs the ternary expression, preserving the original semantics.\n\nLooking deeper into the function, there's a section where it checks if both then and else branches are foldable expression blocks and if their expressions are of the same type. If they are assignments, it further checks if they assign to the same variable and\u662f\u5426\u6709\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\n\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u5373\u4f7fthen\u548celse\u5206\u652f\u4e0d\u662f\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u8d4b\u503c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e09\u5143\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5c06\u6574\u4e2a\u8d4b\u503c\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u653e\u5728\u4e09\u5143\u8fd0\u7b97\u7b26\u4e2d\u3002\n\n\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u7684:\n",
