We need to ensure that this configuration matches the expected behavior for encoding and decoding.\n\n2. **Encoding and Decoding Modes**:\n    - The javadoc comments suggest that this constructor creates a Base64 codec for decoding all variants and encoding in URL-unsafe mode with no chunking.\n    - We need to verify that the encoding table and other properties are correctly set.\n\n3. **Test Failures**:\n    - Both `testEncoder` and `testBinaryEncoder` fail at test case 1, indicating a problem with the encoding output for a specific input.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `Base64` constructor initializes the codec correctly, matching the behavior of the previous version. Here\u2019s how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Check the Delegate Constructor**:\n    - Investigate what the `this(false)` constructor does and ensure that it sets the correct properties for encoding and decoding.\n\n2. **Verify Encoding Table**:\n    - Ensure that the encoding table used is `STANDARD_ENCODE_TABLE` as mentioned in the javadoc.\n\n3. **Line Length Configuration**:\n    - Confirm that the line length is set to 0 for no chunking.\n\n4. **Decoding Variants**:\n    - Ensure that the decoder can handle all variants of Base64 encoding.\n\nGiven this, let's assume that the delegate constructor `this(false)` might not be setting all the required properties correctly. We need to explicitly set these properties in the no-argument constructor to match the expected behavior.\n\n### Fixed Code\n\nTo fix the constructor, we can explicitly set the encoding table and line length in the no-argument constructor.
