    "generation": "   Node callTarget = n.getFirstChild();\n   if (callTarget == null || !NodeUtil.isGetProp(callTarget)) {\n     return n;\n   }\n   ```\n\n   This checks if the node is a call to a property, like `array.join`.\n\n2. **Check the right-hand side of the call:**\n\n   ```java\n   Node right = callTarget.getNext();\n   if (right != null) {\n     if (!NodeUtil.isImmutableValue(right)) {\n       return n;\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   This seems to check if the argument to `join` is an immutable value, like a string literal.\n\n3. **Get the array and function name:**\n\n   ```java\n   Node arrayNode = callTarget.getFirstChild();\n   Node functionName = arrayNode.getNext();\n   if ((arrayNode.getType() != Token.ARRAYLIT) ||\n       !functionName.getString().equals(\"join\")) {\n     return n;\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Ensures that it's an array literal calling the `join` method.\n\n4. **Determine the join string:**\n\n   ```java\n   String joinString = (right == null) ? \",\" : NodeUtil.getStringValue(right);\n   ```\n\n   If no argument is provided to `join`, it defaults to a comma.\n\n5. **Process the array elements:**\n\n   The function then iterates through the array elements, trying to concatenate strings where possible, and handling non-string values by keeping them separate.\n\n   This is where things might be going wrong, especially with different types of elements in the array.\n\n6. **Calculate costs and decide whether to fold:**\n\n   It estimates the size before and after folding and only performs the optimization if it results in smaller code.\n\nLooking at the test failures, it seems like the function isn't handling all cases correctly, particularly when there are non-string values in the array or when the join string is not a simple comma.\n\nLet me look at one of the failing tests:\n\n- `x = ['a', foo, 'b', 'c'].join(',')` should be folded to `x = [\\\"a\\\",foo,\\\"b,c\\\"].join()`.\n\n   This suggests that the function should leave non-string values as is and only concatenate adjacent string literals.\n\nAnother test:\n\n- `x = ['a', '5'].join(7)` should be folded to `x = \\\"a75\\\"`.\n\n   Here, the join string is '7', and it's concatenating 'a' + '7' + '5'.\n\nAlso, there's a test where folding shouldn't happen because it's not a size win:\n\n- `x = ['a', '5', 'c'].join('a very very very long chain')` should remain as is.\n\nI need to ensure that the function correctly handles these cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Incorrect handling of non-string elements in the array.\n\n- Not properly concatenating adjacent string literals.\n\n- Incorrect calculation of the folded size.\n\n- Failing to handle cases where the join string is not a comma.\n\nLet me try to think about how to fix this.\n\nFirst, I need to iterate through the array elements and group consecutive string literals, joining them with the join string.\n\nFor example, in `['a', foo, 'b', 'c'].join(',')`:\n\n- 'a' is a string.\n\n- foo is not a string.\n\n- 'b' and 'c' are strings.\n\nSo, it should fold 'b' and 'c' into 'b,c', and keep foo as is.\n\nSimilarly, in `['a', '5'].join(7)`, it should fold 'a' + '7' + '5' into 'a75'.\n\nI need to make sure that non-string elements are handled correctly, meaning they should be kept separate and passed to the join method as is.\n\nAlso, I need to correctly calculate the size before and after folding to decide whether to perform the optimization.\n\nLet me think about the logic:\n\n1. Iterate through the array elements.\n\n2. If an element is a string literal, accumulate it into a StringBuilder, separated by the join string.\n\n3. If an element is not a string literal, flush the current StringBuilder to a new string node, and add the non-string element as is.\n\n4. After processing all elements, if there's anything in the StringBuilder, add it as a string node.\n\n5. Replace the original array and join call with the folded version if it's smaller.\n\nI need to handle the edge cases, such as empty arrays, arrays with only one element, arrays with only non-string elements, etc.\n\nLet me try to write a corrected version of the function.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo fix the `tryFoldArrayJoin` method, we need to ensure that it correctly handles various scenarios when folding array joins, such as handling non-string values and optimizing only when it results in smaller code.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check the Call Target:** Ensure the call target is a property get on an array.\n2. **Determine the Join String:** Use the provided join string or default to a comma if none is provided.\n3. **Process Array Elements:** Iterate through the array elements, concatenating adjacent string literals with the join string while keeping non-string elements separate.\n4. **Calculate Costs:** Estimate the size before and after folding to decide whether to perform the optimization.\n5. **Replace Nodes:** Replace the original node with the optimized version if it results in smaller code.\n\n### Solution Code\n",
