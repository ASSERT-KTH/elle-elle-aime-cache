If such a method doesn't exist, I might need to set it through the solver's constructor or a setter method.\n\nAssuming that `getMaxEvaluations()` exists, I can proceed with this approach.\n\nAnother consideration is that the exception should probably include information about the maximum number of evaluations allowed. So, the constructor for `TooManyEvaluationsException` might take the maximum evaluations as a parameter.\n\nGiven that, I can proceed to implement this in the code.\n\nLet me also consider if there is a more efficient way to handle this, perhaps by using a try-finally block to ensure that the counter is always incremented, but in Java, exceptions don't affect the increment operation as long as it's placed before the function call.\n\nWait, actually, if the exception is thrown after incrementing the counter but before the function call, it would still be correct because the function wasn't evaluated. So, it's better to increment the counter before checking and before the function call.\n\nLet me adjust the plan:\n\n1. **Initialize the evaluation counter:**\n\n   ```java\n   int evaluations = 0;\n   int maxEvaluations = getMaxEvaluations();\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial evaluations:**\n\n   ```java\n   evaluations++;\n   if (evaluations > maxEvaluations) {\n       throw new TooManyEvaluationsException(maxEvaluations);\n   }\n   double f0 = computeObjectiveValue(x0);\n\n   evaluations++;\n   if (evaluations > maxEvaluations) {\n       throw new TooManyEvaluationsException(maxEvaluations);\n   }\n   double f1 = computeObjectiveValue(x1);\n   ```\n\n3. **Inside the loop:**\n\n   - Before computing `fx`:\n\n     ```java\n     evaluations++;\n     if (evaluations > maxEvaluations) {\n         throw new TooManyEvaluationsException(maxEvaluations);\n     }\n     double fx = computeObjectiveValue(x);\n     ```\n\n   - If `computeObjectiveValue(x0)` is called inside the loop:\n\n     ```java\n     evaluations++;\n     if (evaluations > maxEvaluations) {\n         throw new TooManyEvaluationsException(maxEvaluations);\n     }\n     f0 = computeObjectiveValue(x0);\n     ```\n\nThis seems straightforward. Now, I need to make sure that `getMaxEvaluations()` is a valid method. If it's not, I need to define it or find another way to get the maximum evaluations allowed.\n\nAssuming that `getMaxEvaluations()` is part of the solver's configuration, I can proceed.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that `TooManyEvaluationsException` is imported correctly.\n\nGiven all that, I can proceed to implement these changes in the `doSolve` method.\n\nLet me think about potential edge cases:\n\n- If `maxEvaluations` is set to a very low number, say 2, then only the initial evaluations would be allowed, and the loop wouldn't even start.\n- If `maxEvaluations` is set to 0, perhaps it should throw the exception immediately, but it's unlikely that someone would set it to 0. Maybe the minimum allowed is 1.\n- If `maxEvaluations` is not set, perhaps it has a default value.\n\nI need to make sure that `getMaxEvaluations()` returns a sensible value. If it's not set, maybe it returns a large number or throws an exception. But for the purpose of this fix, I'll assume that `getMaxEvaluations()` returns a valid positive integer.\n\nAnother consideration is that if the root is found in the initial evaluations, the loop doesn't run, and the exception isn't relevant.\n\nAlso, if the loop exits due to meeting the accuracy conditions, that's fine, and the exception shouldn't be thrown.\n\nThe key is to ensure that if the loop runs too many times, exceeding the maximum evaluations, the exception is thrown instead of continuing indefinitely or without limit.\n\nAlright, with this plan in mind, I can proceed to implement the changes in the `doSolve` method.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo fix the provided buggy code, we need to ensure that the `doSolve` method throws a `TooManyEvaluationsException` when the number of function evaluations exceeds the maximum allowed evaluations. This will prevent infinite loops or excessive computations and align the behavior with the expected test results.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialize Evaluation Counter:** \n   - Introduce a counter to track the number of function evaluations.\n   - Retrieve the maximum number of evaluations allowed from the solver's configuration.\n\n2. **Check Evaluations Before Each Function Call:**\n   - Increment the evaluation counter before each call to `computeObjectiveValue`.\n   - Check if the evaluation count exceeds the maximum allowed evaluations. If it does, throw a `TooManyEvaluationsException`.\n\n3. **Apply This Logic in Initial Evaluations and Loop:**\n   - Apply the above steps for initial evaluations and within the iterative solution-finding loop.\n\n### Solution Code\n",
