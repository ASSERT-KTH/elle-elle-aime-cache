    "generation": "   if (p.canReadTypeId()) {\n       Object typeId = p.getTypeId();\n       if (typeId != null) {\n           return _deserializeWithNativeTypeId(p, ctxt, typeId);\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n   This part checks if the parser can read type IDs natively (likely using JSON Pointer or similar), and if so, it handles deserialization accordingly. Since the error occurs later, presumably this branch is not taken.\n\n2. **Sanity Checks:**\n   ```java\n   if (p.getCurrentToken() != JsonToken.START_OBJECT) {\n       throw ctxt.wrongTokenException(p, JsonToken.START_OBJECT,\n               \"need JSON Object to contain As.WRAPPER_OBJECT type information for class \" + baseTypeName());\n   }\n   ```\n   This is where the exception is being thrown. It expects the current token to be `START_OBJECT`, but instead, it's encountering a `FIELD_NAME`.\n\n   Wait a minute, if the parser is in state where the current token is `FIELD_NAME` when it was expecting `START_OBJECT`, something is off. Perhaps there's a mismatch in the JSON structure being processed.\n\n3. **Processing Field Name:**\n   ```java\n   if (p.nextToken() != JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\n       throw ctxt.wrongTokenException(p, JsonToken.FIELD_NAME,\n               \"need JSON String that contains type id (for subtype of \" + baseTypeName() + \")\");\n   }\n   final String typeId = p.getText();\n   p.nextToken();\n   ```\n   After ensuring that the current token is `START_OBJECT`, it moves to the next token, expecting it to be `FIELD_NAME`, which contains the type ID.\n\n   But according to the error, the initial token is already `FIELD_NAME`, not `START_OBJECT`. This suggests that the JSON being processed doesn't have the expected structure.\n\n4. **Type Deserializer Lookup:**\n   ```java\n   JsonDeserializer<Object> deser = _findDeserializer(ctxt, typeId);\n   ```\n   This line looks up the appropriate deserializer based on the type ID.\n\n5. **Merging Type ID (if needed):**\n   ```java\n   if (_typeIdVisible && p.getCurrentToken() == JsonToken.START_OBJECT) {\n       TokenBuffer tb = new TokenBuffer(null, false);\n       tb.writeStartObject();\n       tb.writeFieldName(_typePropertyName);\n       tb.writeString(typeId);\n       p = JsonParserSequence.createFlattened(tb.asParser(p), p);\n       p.nextToken();\n   }\n   ```\n   If type IDs are visible, it creates a new parser that includes the type ID as a property in the object.\n\n6. **Deserialization:**\n   ```java\n   Object value = deser.deserialize(p, ctxt);\n   ```\n   Delegates the deserialization to the appropriate deserializer.\n\n7. **Expecting Closing `END_OBJECT`:**\n   ```java\n   if (p.nextToken() != JsonToken.END_OBJECT) {\n       throw ctxt.wrongTokenException(p, JsonToken.END_OBJECT,\n               \"expected closing END_OBJECT after type information and deserialized value\");\n   }\n   return value;\n   ```\n   Ensures that after deserialization, the parser encounters `END_OBJECT`.\n\nGiven the error, it seems like the JSON being processed doesn't start with `START_OBJECT` as expected, but instead starts with `FIELD_NAME`.\n\nLooking back at the test case:\n",
