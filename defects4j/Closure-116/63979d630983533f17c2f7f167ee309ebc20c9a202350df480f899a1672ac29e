    "generation": "  function foo(a){return modifyX() + a;} foo(x);\n  ```\n  - Here, `modifyX()` likely has side effects, and `a` is used once. But the test expects `CanInlineResult.NO`, meaning the method is incorrectly allowing inlining.\n\n- **testIssue1101b:**\n  ```javascript\n  function foo(a){return (x.prop = 2),a;} foo(x.prop);\n  ```\n  - This sets `x.prop` to 2 and returns `a`. The call `foo(x.prop)` passes `x.prop` as an argument. Likely, modifying `x.prop` has side effects, and the test expects inlining to be disallowed.\n\n- **testBug4944818:**\n  - This test seems more complex, involving multiple function calls and property accesses. The error suggests that inlining is being allowed when it shouldn't be.\n\n- **testDoubleInlining2:**\n  ```javascript\n  var foo = function(a) { return getWindow(a); };\n  var bar = function(b) { return b; };\n  foo(bar(x));\n  ```\n  - Here, `bar(x)` is passed to `foo`, and `bar` simply returns its argument. The test expects the result to be `{getWindow(x)}`, but perhaps there's an issue with how arguments are being handled.\n\n- **testIssue1101:**\n  ```javascript\n  var x = (function (saved) {\n      return foo(obj) + saved;\n  })(obj[\"prop\"]);\n  ```\n  - An immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that adds `foo(obj)` to `saved`, which is `obj[\"prop\"]`. The test seems to expect proper handling of the argument.\n\n- **testInlineIfParametersModified8 and testInlineIfParametersModified9:**\n  - These tests involve functions that modify their arguments (object and array properties), and the expectation is that inlining is allowed in these cases.\n\n- **testInlineFunctions6:**\n  ```javascript\n  function BAR_FN(x, y, z) { return z(nochg(x + y)) }\n  alert(BAR_FN(1, 2, baz))\n  ```\n  - This test involves more complex argument passing and function calls. The expected output suggests that the function should be inlined correctly.\n\nFrom these tests, it appears that the method is incorrectly allowing inlining in cases where arguments have side effects and are used multiple times in the function's body. Conversely, in tests where arguments are modified within the function, inlining is allowed, which seems correct.\n\nLooking back at the method, the condition that seems problematic is:\n",
