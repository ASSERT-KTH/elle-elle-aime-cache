    "generation": "  v1 = new Vector3D(FastMath.sqrt(u1u1 / v1v1), v1);\n  ```\n  This scales v1 so that its norm matches that of u1. Seems reasonable.\n\n- **Adjusting v2:**\n  ```java\n  double beta = FastMath.sqrt((u2u2 - u1u2 * coeffU) / (v2v2 - v1v2 * coeffV));\n  double alpha = coeffU - beta * coeffV;\n  v2 = new Vector3D(alpha, v1, beta, v2);\n  ```\n  This adjusts v2 to match certain conditions related to dot products and norms. Again, seems okay, but need to ensure that the arguments to sqrt are non-negative.\n\n- **Computing k and c:**\n  ```java\n  Vector3D k = v1Su1.crossProduct(v2Su2);\n  double c = k.dotProduct(u3);\n  ```\n  Here, k is the cross product of (v1 - u1) and (v2 - u2), and c is its dot product with u3 = u1 cross u2.\n\n  If k and u3 are parallel or anti-parallel, their dot product could be zero, leading to potential division by zero later.\n\n- **Handling c == 0:**\n  The code has several branches to handle cases where c is zero, trying different vectors to compute k and c.\n\n- **Computing the vectorial part:**\n  ```java\n  c = FastMath.sqrt(c);\n  double inv = 1.0 / (c + c);\n  q1 = inv * k.getX();\n  q2 = inv * k.getY();\n  q3 = inv * k.getZ();\n  ```\n  Here, c is square-rooted, so c must be non-negative. If c is zero, sqrt(0) = 0, leading to division by zero in inv.\n\nThis is likely the source of the NaNs. If c is zero, inv becomes infinity, and multiplying by k's components could result in NaN if k has zero components.\n\nSo, I need to handle the case when c is zero more carefully. The code already has branches to try different vectors when c is zero, but apparently, in some cases, c remains zero, leading to division by zero.\n\nLooking at the test case that fails:\n",
