If `array1` is of type `Integer[]` and `array2` is of type `Long[]`, the new array will be of type `Integer[]`, which cannot hold `Long` objects, leading to an `ArrayStoreException`.\n\n### Solution Approach\n\nTo fix this issue, the method needs to determine a compatible component type for the new array that can hold elements from both input arrays. The most general type that both arrays can be stored in should be used.\n\nIn Java, arrays are covariant, meaning that an array of a superclass can hold instances of its subclasses. Therefore, the component type of the new array should be the least specific common supertype of the component types of `array1` and `array2`.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nHere is the revised `addAll` method that addresses the type compatibility issue:\n",
