    "generation": "  case Token.NEW:\n    // TODO(nicksantos): This needs to be changed so that it\n    // returns true iff we're sure the value was never aliased from inside\n    // the constructor (similar to callHasLocalResult)\n    return true;\n  ```\n\n  This todo suggests that the implementation is incomplete or incorrect.\n\n- **Token.CALL:**\n\n  The function checks if the call has a local result or if it's a `toString` method call, or applies the local predicate to the entire call node.\n\n  ```java\n  case Token.CALL:\n    return callHasLocalResult(value)\n        || isToStringMethodCall(value)\n        || locals.apply(value);\n  ```\n\n  It might not be sufficient to only check if the call has a local result or if it's `toString`. There might be other method calls that should not be considered local.\n\n- **Token.GETELEM and Token.GETPROP:**\n\n  These are assumed to be non-local.\n\n  ```java\n  case Token.GETELEM:\n  case Token.GETPROP:\n    // There is no information about the locality of object properties.\n    return locals.apply(value);\n  ```\n\n  This might be correct, but need to ensure that if the object is local and its properties are not aliased, then accessing a property could be considered local.\n\n- **Token.INC and Token.DEC:**\n\n  For prefix increments and decrements, it returns the result of checking the child node, assuming that the result is a local value.\n\n  ```java\n  case Token.INC:\n  case Token.DEC:\n    if (value.getBooleanProp(Node.INCRDECR_PROP)) {\n      return evaluatesToLocalValue(value.getFirstChild(), locals);\n    } else {\n      return true;\n    }\n  ```\n\n  For postfix operations, it returns `true`, which might be incorrect if the operand is not local.\n\n- **Token.NAME:**\n\n  Checks if the name corresponds to an immutable value or applies the local predicate.\n\n  ```java\n  case Token.NAME:\n    return isImmutableValue(value) || locals.apply(value);\n  ```\n\n  Need to ensure that `isImmutableValue` correctly identifies names that are constants or local variables.\n\n- **Token.ARRAYLIT and Token.OBJECTLIT:**\n\n  Always return `true`, assuming that literals are local.\n\n  ```java\n  case Token.ARRAYLIT:\n  case Token.OBJECTLIT:\n    // Literals objects with non-literal children are allowed.\n    return true;\n  ```\n\n  However, object literals can contain references to non-local values, so this might need to be revisited.\n\nGiven these potential issues, here's a plan to fix the function:\n\n1. **Improve handling of `Token.NEW`:**\n\n   - Determine if the constructor call can be considered to produce a local value.\n\n   - Perhaps only consider it local if the constructor doesn't access or modify external state.\n\n2. **Refine `Token.CALL` handling:**\n\n   - Ensure that `callHasLocalResult` accurately determines if the call results in a local value.\n\n   - Consider the target of the method call and its potential side effects.\n\n3. **Reevaluate `Token.GETELEM` and `Token.GETPROP`:**\n\n   - If the object is local and not aliased, accessing its properties could be considered local.\n\n   - This might require tracking aliases or assuming that properties of local objects are local.\n\n4. **Adjust `Token.INC` and `Token.DEC`:**\n\n   - For postfix operations, ensure that the operand is local before considering the result local.\n\n5. **Review `Token.ARRAYLIT` and `Token.OBJECTLIT`:**\n\n   - Ensure that literals are indeed local, but be cautious of literals that contain references to non-local values.\n\n   - Possibly recursively check the elements of arrays and properties of objects.\n\n6. **General improvements:**\n\n   - Ensure that the `locals` predicate is correctly applied to name nodes.\n\n   - Make sure that all node types are handled appropriately, especially those involved in the failing tests.\n\nI'll proceed to implement these changes step by step, ensuring that each modification aligns with the intended behavior described in the Javadoc.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo fix the `evaluatesToLocalValue` function, we need to ensure that it correctly identifies whether a node represents a value that is local to the expression scope. We will make adjustments to handle different node types appropriately, considering their potential to reference or modify external state.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Handle `Token.NEW` correctly**: We need to determine if the constructor call produces a local value without side effects.\n2. **Refine `Token.CALL` handling**: Ensure that method calls are properly evaluated for local results.\n3. **Evaluate property accesses**: Consider if property accesses on local objects should be treated as local.\n4. **Adjust increment and decrement operations**: Ensure that operands are local before considering the result local.\n5. **Review literals**: Ensure that array and object literals are treated as local, but be cautious of references to non-local values within them.\n\n### Solution Code\n",
