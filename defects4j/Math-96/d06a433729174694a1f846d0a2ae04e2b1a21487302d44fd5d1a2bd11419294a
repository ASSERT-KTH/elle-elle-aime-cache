The bit-level comparison using `Double.doubleToRawLongBits` would consider them different.\n\nIn the `Complex` class, do we need to consider `0.0` and `-0.0` as equal?\n\nAccording to the Java language specification, `0.0.equals(-0.0)` returns true, even though their bit representations are different.\n\nHowever, using `Double.doubleToRawLongBits`, `0.0` and `-0.0` would have different bit representations.\n\nSo, in the `equals` method, if both real and imaginary parts are zero, but with different signs, should they be considered equal?\n\nIn mathematical terms, +0 and -0 are equal, so yes, they should be considered equal.\n\nTherefore, the current implementation might be incorrectly considering `0.0` and `-0.0` as different.\n\nHow to fix this?\n\nInstead of using `Double.doubleToRawLongBits`, we can use `Double.valueOf(real).equals(Double.valueOf(rhs.getReal()))` and similarly for the imaginary part. This way, `0.0.equals(-0.0)` returns true.\n\nAlternatively, we can check if both values are zero and consider them equal regardless of sign.\n\nBut using `Double.equals` is cleaner and handles all cases, including NaN.\n\nWait, but NaN is tricky because `Double.NaN.equals(Double.NaN)` returns false, since `Double.equals` delegates to `double` equality, and NaN is not equal to itself.\n\nBut in the `equals` method, there's a special case for NaN:\n",
